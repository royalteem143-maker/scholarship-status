Learning Marathon Challenge - Static Website Starter Kit

Files included:
- index.html
- register.html
- payment.html
- exam_instructions.html
- contact.html
- assets/styles.css
- assets/main.js
- README.txt

How to use:
1. Unzip the package and open index.html locally to preview.
2. Replace placeholders:
   - In register.html: replace GOOGLE_FORM_EMBED_LINK_HERE with the iframe embed URL of your Google Form.
     Also replace GOOGLE_FORM_PUBLIC_LINK_HERE with the regular public link.
   - In payment.html: replace the UPI ID (yourupi@bank) and add your QR code image if available.
   - Update contact details in contact.html.
3. To publish:
   - Upload the folder to any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) or to your hosting provider
     (Hostinger, Bluehost). If using Hostinger with WordPress you can still host static pages in a folder.
4. Optional enhancements:
   - Integrate Razorpay Payment Pages: paste the payment link on payment.html and in the registration instructions.
   - Replace the registration iframe approach with an embedded payment verification flow if you later build a backend.
   - Use Google Sheets + Apps Script for auto-messaging admit cards.
5. Need help? Reply to this chat and I can:
   - Replace placeholders for you (provide Google Form link, UPI ID, WhatsApp number).
   - Convert to a simple deployable WordPress theme.
   - Add analytics or WhatsApp automation instructions.
